## Notes
- Inventory reservations use a 15â€‘minute TTL and are marked EXPIRED by a periodic check on reads; a cron/BackgroundTask can be added for proactive cleanup.
- Cart merge endpoint merges by SKU and sums quantities, preserving lowest price_snapshot.
- Admin endpoints expose minimal packing task lifecycle; courier booking webhook is handled by Chung's service.
